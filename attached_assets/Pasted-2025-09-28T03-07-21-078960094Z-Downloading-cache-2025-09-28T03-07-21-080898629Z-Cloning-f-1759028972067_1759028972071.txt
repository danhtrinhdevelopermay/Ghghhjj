2025-09-28T03:08:03.458208758Z To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (/opt/render/project/poetry/bin) in your `PATH`
2025-09-28T03:08:03.458213198Z environment variable.
2025-09-28T03:08:03.458216668Z 
2025-09-28T03:08:03.458220228Z Add `export PATH="/opt/render/project/poetry/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration file.
2025-09-28T03:08:03.458223719Z 
2025-09-28T03:08:03.4582358Z Alternatively, you can call Poetry explicitly with `/opt/render/project/poetry/bin/poetry`.
2025-09-28T03:08:03.45823804Z 
2025-09-28T03:08:03.45824023Z You can test that everything is set up by executing:

2025-09-28T03:08:06.225238154Z       If you are trying to create a single distribution with multiple packages
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225242154Z       on purpose, you should not rely on automatic discovery.
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225245885Z       Instead, consider the following options:
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225249805Z       
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225253595Z       1. set up custom discovery (`find` directive with `include` or `exclude`)
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225257376Z       2. use a `src-layout`
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225261176Z       3. explicitly set `py_modules` or `packages` with a list of names
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225264776Z       
2025-09-28T03:08:06.225268456Z       To find more information, look for "package discovery" on setuptools docs.
